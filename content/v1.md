# API v1

This describes the resources that make up the official Luexiao API v1. If

## Schema

### For beta use
All API access is accessed from the `mayday.fm:3000`
domain.  All data is sent and received as JSON.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i http://mayday.fm:3000

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4999
Content-Length: 2

{}
</pre>

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

## HTTP Verbs

Where possible, API v1 strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each
action.

HEAD
: Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.

GET
: Used for retrieving resources.

POST
: Used for creating resources, or performing custom actions (such as
merging a pull request).

PUT
: Used for replacing resources or collections.

DELETE
: Used for deleting resources.

## Authentication

There are only one way to authenticate through Luexiao API v1:

Token (sent as a parameter):

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://mayday.fm:3000/questions.json?auth_token=AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN
</pre>

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 30 items by
default.  You can specify further pages with the `?page` parameter.  You
can also set a custom page size up to 100 with the `?per_page` parameter.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://mayday.fm:3000/questions.json?page=2&per_page=100
</pre>

The pagination info is included in [the Link header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/9707-link-header.html):

    Link: <http://mayday.fm:3000/questions.json?page=3&per_page=100>; rel="next",
      <http://mayday.fm:3000/questions.json?page=50&per_page=100>; rel="last"

_Linebreak is included for readability._

The possible `rel` values are:

`next`
: Shows the URL of the immediate next page of results.

`last`
: Shows the URL of the last page of results.

`first`
: Shows the URL of the first page of results.

`prev`
: Shows the URL of the immediate previous page of results.
